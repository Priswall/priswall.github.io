        <h6 class="section-title">How has programming improved over the years?</h6>
        <h3 class="section-text">
            Ever since the first computers, programming was a thing. <br>
            It was very simple, and could calculte very simple math. <br>
            Sounds cool, right? It is, if you don't mind waiting up to an <br>
            hour to find out a problem on your math homework. Or if <br>
            you don't like viewing images. Or if you don't like browsing the web <br>

        <h6 class="section-title">What even <em>is</em> programming?</h6>
        <h3 class="section-text">
            Programming is pretty much like talking, using single words <br>
            and sentences to make essays and books that can portray anything. <br>
            However, just like everyday language, it has improved since the <br>
            beginning and will always have room to improve <br>

        </h3>

        <h6 class="section-title">What programming languages are there?</h6>
        <h3 class="section-text">
            This is a list of some programming languages in order from oldest to newest <br>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regional_Assembly_Language&action=edit&redlink=1">Regional Assembly Language</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a></li>

            </ul>

        </h3>

        <h6 class="section-title">How can we improve it?</h6>
        <h3 class="section-text">
            Just like it has in the past: Wait for better processors <br>
            or create a new programming language that is more efficient <br>
            or easier for people to use. This is why this stuff is important <br>
            because not many people are making new languages these days, so <br>
            the effifiency of them becomes outdated as better processors are made <br>

        <p style="font-size: 2vw; margin-top: 5vw">Below is a table showing different processing chips developed over time.<br>
        Pay attention to the number of operations per second and how they improved<br>
        and think about how much potential is being wasted from outdated programming languages</p>
